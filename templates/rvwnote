It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justification 

protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life


 additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation. 


 ** life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.



#logic:
TORT LAW: civil injury: denied recovery for prenatal injuries even if child born alive. (when rights contigent on live birth) recovery permitted if fetus viable..   unborn never recognized in law as persons when $



 until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth
  regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.

This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this "compelling" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. 

if about protecting woman's health
mortality in abortion < mortality normal birth, protecting mother means abortion before compelling point.
protection after viability make sense (to texas) unless health of mother

therefore restricting abortions to those based on medical advicehealth of mother
1196 texas penal code contradicts itself 

* texas law about protecting mother without regard to giability stage violates 14th

1 before viability abortion decision is based on medical judgeemnt
2 the state concern of protecting mother should allow abortion
3 if about health of mother, state ought to endorse abortion

counter claims:
	claims fourth amendement is search and seizure, not privacy. 
		liberty requring 14th amendment embraces more than rights in BoR
		liberty not guaranteed. only gauarenteed without due process

	if texas prohibits abortion when mother's life in jeopardy ...
	says invalidation of any restriction on abortion during 1st tri is 

"contradiction makes sense" but invalidation of any restrictions on abortion impossible to justify under this standard /.impossible to justify under that standard 

says dec partakes more of judicial legislation than determing 14th amendment intent

asserted right to an abortion is not "so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental"

***********
The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter.


# dissenter says majority found a right that the writers of amendment didn't put
# operation is not private, not search and seizure.


dissent:
no state shall make law abridging privelages of citzens:
	(abortion not right, bc abortion not private)

14th amendment: can't deprive life,liberty,property and can't deny equal protection.




#if about viability:
State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications ~ doctor can say before compelling point get abortion. If state 
it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. 


#personal 
 . Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks



 protecting the potential life of the fetus could be asserted only once it became "viable
